Parallel Port Controller - By Josh Gaby

You will need the DLL inpout32.dll, if you dont allready have it you can get it free from:

http://www.logix4u.net/inpout32_source_and_bins.zip

it comes with source code for Borland C++, VC and VB.

This program is copywrited, if you wish to utilise it in your own work
you must give credit where credit is due, it would also be nice if you
could send me a link to where I can see what you have done with my work.

My email address is:

If you like it or find it usefull then please to vote for me
